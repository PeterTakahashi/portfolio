              I&apos;m Seiya Takahashi. A software engineer based in Tokyo, Japan. Mainly working on rails web backend and react frontend. but I love to learn new things and try to build open source projects with Solidity, FastAPI, Python, SwiftUI, and more.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am a software engineer who places particular emphasis on readability, scalability, high performance, and writing bug-free code. Having worked mainly at small companies, I have gained broad experience and am capable of handling the entire development cycle independently â€” from system design to implementation and testing.
            </p>
            <p>
              I have been involved in more than 30 projects so far, and in most cases no bugs were reported after release.
              Although my English is not yet at a business level, I am able to communicate to some extent.
              I&apos;m still learning English, but I can read and write technical documents.
