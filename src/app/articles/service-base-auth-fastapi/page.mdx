    "This is a starter project for building an AI web service with FastAPI and React. If you're using the fastapi-users library for authentication, you'll find there's a lot to set up: configuring APIs, setting up Google and GitHub OAuth, adding tests with pytest, setting up a code linter, and more. It can take a lot of time.",
